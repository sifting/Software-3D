# r3d
Simple software 3D

Shows off a basic 8-bit colour 3D implementation done from scratch in C. It has been modernised a bit with SDL for portability,
and includes some SIMD code for fun. Shading is accomplished via a shade table that remaps colours from the base palette to
darker ones, and may be generated with the included script.
